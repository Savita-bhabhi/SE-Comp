# Python program to manage library book borrowing records

# Sample data
# Let's store member borrow counts in a list (each element = number of books borrowed by a member)
member_borrow_counts = [3, 5, 0, 2, 7, 0, 4, 7, 2]

# Let's store book borrowing counts in a dictionary (key = book name, value = times borrowed)
book_borrow_counts = {

    "Java": 8,
    "Python": 22,
    "Maths": 5,
    "English": 22,
    "C Programming": 3
}

# 1) Average number of books borrowed by members
def average_books_borrowed(member_counts):
    total = sum(member_counts)
    count = len(member_counts)
    return total / count if count != 0 else 0


# 2) Book with highest and lowest borrow count
def highest_and_lowest_borrowed_books(book_counts):
    highest = max(book_counts, key=book_counts.get)
    lowest = min(book_counts, key=book_counts.get)
    return highest, lowest


# 3) Count members who have borrowed 0 books
def count_zero_borrowers(member_counts):
    return member_counts.count(0)


# 4) Most frequently borrowed book (Mode)
def most_frequently_borrowed_book(book_counts):
    max_value = max(book_counts.values())
    # There can be multiple books with same highest count
    mode_books = [book for book, count in book_counts.items() if count == max_value]
    return mode_books
